                <h2>Malcom X Sociology Paper</h2>
                <p>In my Introduction to Sociology class with Dr. Laura Fischer, I completed a project that included an essay as well as an art project to creatively demonstrate the discussed themes. For the paper, we were asked to provide a sociological analysis of an aspect of Malcom X's life. Throughout the semester, we read a book about the life of Malcom X and discussed his development in sociological terms. I chose to write my paper about how the process of socialization influenced Malcom X's values, beliefs, and political views throughout his life. For the art project portion of the assignment, I created a watercolor portrait of Malcom X. I used many shapes and colors to represent the underlying elements that made Malcom X who he was. Each shape and color represented a different agent in the process of socialization that influenced his views of the world. </p>
