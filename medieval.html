                <h2>Medieval Medicine Paper</h2>
                <p>For my Medieval Theology course with Dr. Steven McMichael, we were asked to choose a topic to research relating to medieval Christians and their theological world. I chose to write my paper about the influence of Christianity on medieval medicine. I did thorough research on my chosen topic and gathered various scholarly articles using the St. Thomas library online research tool. Combining what I learned throughout the semester with the information found in these sources, I argued that the Christian church had a large influence on medieval medicine, and as a result, both natural and religious theories were used to diagnose and treat illnesses. I concluded the essay by discussing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the modern-day relationship between medicine and religion. </p>
                <p>This project demonstrates several important skills I've learned at St. Thomas. I needed to do detailed research to find reliable sources on the topic I chose. I developed the ability to evaluate the credibility of a source to determine if it can be considered reliable and accurate. I also learned how to effectively form a strong argument. The topic I chose had an abundance of information, so I needed to narrow down the material I found in order to form a clear and concise argument in my paper. This included organizing the information in a way that flowed properly so that the reader could understand the material and my thesis. Another skill shown through this paper is my ability to connect information to relevant modern events. I linked the information I learned through my research to the trends I was observing surrounding the spread of COVID-19. I took the Medieval Theology class and wrote this paper in the Fall semester of 2020 during the height of the pandemic. I recognized that what many people feel today from the stress of the unknown virus is very similar to what people may have felt in the Middle Ages when they had little to no concrete knowledge on how to treat illnesses. </p>
