                <p>Click <a href='https://github.com/post3024/DynamicWebServer' target = '_blank'>here</a> to view the GitHub with source code.</p>
                <p>In my website development class with Dr. Marrinan, I worked in a group with two other students to create a dynamic web page that displays information on U.S. energy consumption. Using the website, a user can view energy consumption by year, state, or energy type using the menu at the top of the page.</p>
                <h3>Energy Consumption by Year:</h3>
                <p>To view energy information by year, the user selects the year option at the top of the page and selects the specific year they would like to see. The web page displays a pie chart with the energy usage for the different energy types for the specified year, as well as a table with energy consumption information for each energy type for each state in the U.S.</p>

                    <img src='Images/year2.png' alt='year'>
                    <img src='Images/year3.png' alt='year'>
                </div>
                <h3>Energy Consumption by State:</h3>
                <p>To view energy information by state, the user selects the state option at the top of the page, and then selects the state they would like to see. The web page displays the state flag for the specified state, a line graph with energy consumption for each energy type through the years, and a table with energy information for each energy type for each year.</p>
                <div class='center'>
                    <img src='Images/state1.png' alt='state'>

                    <img src='Images/state4.png' alt='state'>
                </div>
                <h3>Energy Consumption by Energy Type:</h3>
                <p>To view energy consumption information by energy type, the user selects the energy type option at the top of the page and selects the energy type they would like to see. The web page displays a line graph with a line for each U.S. state showing energy usage throughout the years. The page also shows a table with energy usage for the specified energy type for each state for each year.</p>
